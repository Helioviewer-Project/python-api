Reporting Issues or Requesting Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned above, building the documentation depends on a number of Sphinx extensions and other packages.
Since it is not always possible to know which package is causing issues or would need to have a new feature implemented, you can open an issue in the official `hvpy repository <https://github.com/Helioviewer-Project/python-api/issues>`__.
However, if you wish, you can also open issues in the `helioviewer API repository <https://github.com/Helioviewer-Project/api/issues>`__.
